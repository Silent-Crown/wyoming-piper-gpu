# Wyoming Piper GPU - Tasks & Todo

## Initial Setup - COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze codebase structure
- [x] Review project components (Dockerfile, patches, scripts)
- [x] Understand Wyoming Piper TTS with GPU acceleration
- [x] Create tasks/todo.md file

## Project Status
The wyoming-piper-gpu project is ready for use. It provides:
- Docker container with NVIDIA CUDA support for Wyoming Piper TTS
- GPU acceleration patches for improved performance
- Environment variable configuration
- CUDA diagnostic tools

## Voice Model Configuration Implementation - COMPLETED
- [x] Research how voice models are configured in Wyoming Piper GPU container
- [x] Identify best practices for managing Docker environment variables as code  
- [x] Create .env file for environment variable management
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml to use .env file
- [x] Create .env.example file with all available options
- [x] Update README.md with voice configuration instructions
- [x] Update tasks/todo.md with plan and review

## Review Section

### Changes Made:

**1. Created Environment File Management System:**
- Added `.env` file with sensible defaults for all Piper configuration options
- Created comprehensive `.env.example` with documentation of available voice models and parameters
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use environment variables with fallback defaults

**2. Improved Documentation:**
- Updated README.md with clear voice configuration instructions
- Added quick start guide using environment files
- Listed popular voice models with descriptions
- Documented all voice quality parameters

**3. Enhanced Configuration Management:**
- Replaced hardcoded values in docker-compose.yml with environment variables
- Used Docker Compose variable substitution with fallback defaults
- Changed volume mount to relative path (`./data:/data`) for easier local development
- Added proper port quoting in docker-compose.yml

### Key Benefits Achieved:
- **Separation of config from code** - Settings now managed in dedicated .env file
- **Security** - .env file not committed to git (already in .gitignore)
- **Documentation** - .env.example serves as comprehensive reference
- **Flexibility** - Easy voice model switching without editing compose file
- **Standards compliance** - Following Docker best practices

### Files Modified:
- **Created:** `.env`, `.env.example`  
- **Updated:** `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`, `tasks/todo.md`
- **Unchanged:** `.gitignore` (already included .env)

### Usage Instructions:
1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. Edit `.env` to set your preferred voice model (e.g., `PIPER_VOICE=en_US-ryan-medium`)
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. Voice models download automatically on first use to `./data` directory

The Wyoming Piper GPU container now has a clean, maintainable configuration system that follows Docker best practices.

## Voice Testing Suite Implementation - COMPLETED
- [x] Research Wyoming protocol for TTS testing
- [x] Create Python test script for voice testing
- [x] Create requirements-test.txt
- [x] Create simple bash test script  
- [x] Create Docker test script
- [x] Document test usage in README
- [x] Update tasks/todo.md with changes

### Voice Testing Changes Made:

**1. Python Test Script (`test_voice.py`):**
- Full-featured Wyoming protocol client
- Connects to container and retrieves server information
- Shows available voices and current configuration
- Synthesizes test text and saves to WAV file
- Automatic audio playback with multiple player support
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Supports custom text, voice models, and server settings

**2. Bash Test Script (`test_voice.sh`):**
- Simple shell-based test for users without Python
- Connection testing and dependency checking
- Falls back to Python script if available
- Cross-platform audio playback support
- Colorized output for better user experience

**3. Docker Test Script (`test_voice_docker.sh`):**
- Runs test from within Docker container
- No local dependencies required
- Connects to Wyoming Piper via Docker network
- Temporary container approach for isolation

**4. Test Requirements (`requirements-test.txt`):**
- Minimal dependencies for testing (wyoming>=1.5.0)
- Optional audio processing libraries documented

**5. Enhanced Documentation:**
- Added comprehensive "Voice Testing" section to README
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Multiple test options for different user preferences
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Audio playback setup instructions

### Key Testing Features:
- **Multi-platform support** - Works on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Multiple test methods** - Python, Bash, Docker options
- **Voice verification** - Shows which model is actually being used
- **Audio output** - Hear the voice to verify configuration
- **Detailed feedback** - Connection status, audio format info, file sizes
- **Troubleshooting** - Built-in diagnostics and error messages

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Quick test with audio playback
python3 test_voice.py --play

# Test specific voice
python3 test_voice.py --voice en_US-ryan-medium --play

# Simple bash test
./test_voice.sh

# Docker test (no dependencies)
./test_voice_docker.sh
```

### Benefits for Users:
- **Verify voice models** - Confirm .env configuration is working
- **Hear voice output** - Actually listen to the TTS to evaluate quality
- **Debug issues** - Identify connection, configuration, or audio problems
- **Test changes** - Quickly verify voice model changes
- **Multiple options** - Choose test method based on available tools

The Wyoming Piper GPU container now includes a complete testing suite that allows users to verify their voice configuration and hear the actual TTS output.
